### About BigGIS

BigGIS is a new generation of GIS that supports decision making in multiple
scenarios which require processing of large and heterogeneous data sets.

The novelty lies in an integrated analytical approach to spatio-temporal data,
that are unstructured and from unreliable sources.
The system provides predictive, prescriptive and visual tool integrated in
a common analytical pipeline.

The prototype will be evaluated on three scenarios - "Smart city", "Environmental management" and "Disaster control".

### Project goals

Development, evaluation and demonstration of a new generation of GIS:

 - Heterogeneous geo-temporal data
 - Integrated analysis of spatio-temporal data
 - Unstructured and unreliable datasets
 - Analytical pipeline for predictive, prescriptive and visual analysis

### Scenarios

 - Smart city and health (urban heat islands, particulate matter)
 - Environmental management (health threatening animals and plants)
 - Disaster control, civil protection (air pollution, toxic chemicals)
